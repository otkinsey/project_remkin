			<h3>About Us</h3>
HandStack is a web & mobile based platform for community partners to develop and organize their volunteer members, as well as promote events to people nearby.

We provide:

<ol style= "list-style-type:none;">
	<li><b>A real-time task list.</b> No more crazy-long email threads! All volunteers can easily collaborate with their team and community partners. Anyone can offer to help with a task and mark it off when they're done.</li>
	<li><b>Location-based event publicity.</b> Reach out to your neighbors, not just your Facebook and Twitter friends! Our geolocation publicity tool helps people nearby to find your event.</li>
</ol>


We help build real movement and impact. Everyone has different talents and resources, and we want to help organizations to mobilize all talents and resources from people involved.

We're just a fun bunch of guys and gals with love for technology and community building. Feel free to give us your ideas & feedback about the app!
